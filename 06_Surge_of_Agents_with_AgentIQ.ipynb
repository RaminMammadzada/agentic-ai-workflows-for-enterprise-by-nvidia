    "# The Surge of Agents with AgentIQ: Integrating Multiple AI Frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this hands-on tutorial on integrating multiple AI frameworks with AgentIQ! In this notebook, we'll transform the \"Surge of Agents\" example into an AgentIQ workflow that orchestrates four powerful frameworks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OpenAI Python Library**: For direct access to language models with a clean API\n",
    "- **LangChain**: For structured data handling and composable processing chains\n",
    "- **LangGraph**: For graph-based workflow management with modular components\n",
    "- **CrewAI**: For collaborative multi-agent orchestration with specialized roles\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight of this tutorial is that **you don't need to rewrite your existing code** to benefit from AgentIQ's orchestration capabilities. Instead, we'll create thin wrapper components that integrate your framework-specific code into a unified workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll understand how to:\n",
    "1. Create AgentIQ components that wrap existing framework code\n",
    "2. Configure a workflow that connects these components\n",
    "3. Run the workflow as a unified system\n",
    "\n",

    "Before diving into the frameworks, we need to establish our development environment. We'll configure access to the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models platform, which provides access to powerful open-source models like Llama 3.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Configuration Elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **API Key**: The authentication token required to access NVIDIA's API services. In production environments, this should be stored securely as an environment variable rather than hardcoded in your notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Endpoint URL**: The base URL that directs our requests to NVIDIA's AI model serving infrastructure. This endpoint handles all communication between our code and the foundation models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Selection**: We're using `meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct`, a powerful open-source LLM that balances performance and efficiency contained in an NVIDIA NIM."
